Ever start building your website and want to make a section of it appear on the right side of the page, but can't seem figure out quite how to do that? Float just became your best friend. Float allows you to take elements and position them almost anywhere you would like on the webpage. Similar to using a table, Float allows you to break up the flow of the webpage and arrange elements to your liking.

When you start to float different elements around your webpage, things can start to get a little tricky though. Without properly stylizing your HTML document using CSS, some elements might be hidden behind other elements and won't display on the webpage. This is where Clear becomes very helpful. Using Clear allows you to have your Floated elements Clear other Floated elements so that they are no longer hidden from view.

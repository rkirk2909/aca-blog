##In Class

The one thing that I've found most interesting in class is pseudo selectors. They allow you to completely customize your webpage with awesome animations and so far it seems that there is no bounds as to how much you can do with them. We've only covered a few of them and the one I've experimented with the most is :hover so it's my favorite so far. You can you use :hover on not only *a* tags (which is the most common use) but pretty much any element that you want. Tonight in class Chris and I definitely put the extent that you can use :hover to the test. We added a :hover pseudo selector to every part of the HTML document for the project tonight and had some fun giving the webpage some much needed color that it was lacking.


##Out of Class

Outside of class, I've looked ahead in the workbook to see what we will be covering in the future and have started to tinker around with some things that we have not yet covered in class and Bootstrap is interesting. I know that you have to setup a link for Bootstrap and this can slow down the loading of your webpage, but it is a very useful tool to have in your arsenal. It allows you to add a lot of customization to your webpage; I'm looking forward to learning about Flexbox in class to see the differences between the two and see the advantages that each one has over the other.

## Flexbox
Starting out, I had a little trouble understanding Flexbox and how it actually worked. I couldn't figure out why elements that I had within my Flexbox weren't moving the way that I wanted or was instructing them to do. But like with most things, the more you practice something and familiarize yourself with it, the better you get at it and a better understading you have of it. Now I'm now saying that I'm a master of Flexbox by any means, but I do now possess a good knowledge of how it works. The biggest issue I realized I was having was getting elements to align vertically within my Flexbox and for the life of me I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. Finally it hit me; I had my "lightbulb" moment: I wasn't defining the height of my Flexbox so it had no idea "center" or "flex-end" was. Once I started defining a designated height everything else started to fall into place. I was able to move elements practically anywhere I wanted to within my Flexbox and I have to say it was a really good feeling. Up until that point I had been fairly comfortable with everything we had gone over in class, I attribute that to all the work I did on Codecademy before class had even begun. Flexbox was the first material that was completely new to me and it showed. Just goes to show how much work you have to put in to reach a level of mere proficiency in the field of coding.
